# Amazon Web Scraping üõí

The "Amazon Web Scraping" project involves extracting valuable information about products from Amazon's website using Python. The project utilizes the power of web scraping to gather data from multiple pages of Amazon search results. It employs libraries like Selenium and BeautifulSoup for navigating the website's structure, extracting details such as product descriptions, prices, ratings, review counts, URLs, and images. The collected data is then transformed, cleaned, and preprocessed using pandas, ensuring its readiness for analysis.

## üìã Steps:

1. Data Collection: The code scrapes Amazon's website for a specified number of pages, collecting product details based on a keyword (e.g., "Laptop"). It extracts information like product descriptions, prices, ratings, review counts, URLs, and images.

2. Data Transformation: The collected data is then formatted and preprocessed using pandas. This step involves cleaning and converting data types to facilitate analysis.

3. Data Analysis: The project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights from the dataset. It calculates correlations between price, ratings, and review counts, providing an overview of the relationships among these variables. Descriptive statistics are also provided to give an overall picture of the data.

4. Visualizations: The project creates visualizations using libraries like seaborn and matplotlib. These visualizations include a heatmap showing correlations, a count plot of ratings frequency, a scatter plot depicting the relationship between ratings and review counts, and a histogram illustrating price distribution.

## ‚ùì Questions Addressed:

The project answers specific questions related to product preferences. Users can input criteria such as top ratings, product keyword searches, specific price queries, and price range filtering. The project dynamically generates responses based on these queries, providing users with product information meeting their specified criteria.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage:

To utilize the project, you can follow these steps:

1. Execute the provided code in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

2. Observe the data collection, transformation, and preprocessing stages.

3. Explore the generated visualizations to gain insights.

4. Experiment with the interactive user queries to find desired product information.
